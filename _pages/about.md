This site is a space for me to "think out loud" about interesting problems in statistics and machine learning. As much as possible, I try to consider different perspectives - theoretical, applied, and computational. If you are new, start [here](https://alexjlim.com/primers).

In general, [blog](https://alexjlim.com/blog) posts are intended to be off the cuff and "back of the napkin" in nature. More detailed expositions (technical and non-technical) can be found [here](https://alexjlim.com/essays).

Additional [resources](https://alexjlim.com/resources) that may be useful in helping advance your understanding of how we learn from data have also been included.

Feel free to reach out at [contact[at]alexjlim[dot]com](mailto:contact@alexjlim.com)!

Thanks for reading,

Alex
