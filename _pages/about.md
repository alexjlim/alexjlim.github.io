This site is a space for me to "think out loud" about interesting problems in statistics and machine learning. If you are new, start [here](https://alexjlim.com/primers).

In general, [blog](https://alexjlim.com/blog) posts are intended to be off the cuff and "back of the napkin" in nature. More detailed expositions can be found be found [here](https://alexjlim.com/essays).

Outside of my own writing, I have also included links to various [resources](https://alexjlim.com/resources) that have been useful in helping advance my understanding about how we learn from data.

Feel free to reach out to me at [contact[at]alexjlim.com](mailto:contact@alexjlim.com).

Thanks for reading,
